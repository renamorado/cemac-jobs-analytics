## 2026-04-06 - Repository guidance setup

### Objective

Create root-level guidance for future agents in a Stata-first empirical research repository and anchor it to the actual current Cameroon materials.

### Files created

- `AGENTS.md`
- `SESSIONS.md`

### Repository state observed

- `Data/Cameroon/Raw/` contains two Cameroon Excel inputs.
- `Data/Cameroon/Clean/` contains `CMR_BDF.dta` and `tax_data.dta`.
- `Data/Cameroon/Do files/` exists but no `.do` files were present during inspection.
- A root-level `Analytics - trade and jobs - Cameroon.docx` file exists and appears to be narrative/background material rather than generated pipeline output.
- No Git repository was initialized at the project root during this session.

### Key decisions

- The repo standard is Stata-first, following the local `stata-dime-repro` skill as binding guidance for Stata work.
- Reproducibility, auditability, and readable sequential do-files are the default workflow principles.
- The intended architecture should center on a root `00_master.do`, a controlled `01_setup.do`, modular `code/` scripts, structured `data/`, generated `output/`, and reproducible LaTeX/slides integration.
- `esttab` / `estout` is the default table workflow.
- Exported tables should be LaTeX fragments for `\input{}` with `booktabs`.
- Manual `filewrite` for regression tables is discouraged and allowed only as a last resort after `esttab`/`estout` options are exhausted.
- Figures should be generated from code, exported reproducibly, and styled consistently for both manuscript and Beamer use.
- Cameroon should be treated as the first country module in a multi-country workflow rather than as a one-off case.
- Because the repo is stored in OneDrive, future agents should expect occasional transient file-lock/write conflicts and use short `sleep`-based retries where overwriting or deleting synced files is fragile.

### Important assumptions

- The current `Data/Cameroon/Clean/` files are treated as existing processed outputs, but the generating code is not yet present in the repo.
- The current `Data/Cameroon/Raw/` location remains the authoritative Cameroon raw-data location until a deliberate migration is implemented.
- Future WBES additions for other countries may involve manually pasted raw files and will need explicit provenance documentation.

### Reproducibility and structure implications

- Future standardization should preserve existing Cameroon assets while building a cleaner forward-looking pipeline around them.
- Any path migration should be documented and done together with reproducible code updates.
- Git/GitHub setup should be paired with a clean `.gitignore` and selective tracking of large or sensitive data.

### Unresolved issues / next steps

- Initialize Git at the project root when ready.
- Add `00_master.do` and `01_setup.do`.
- Recover or write the missing Cameroon processing `.do` files.
- Decide the long-run directory standard for country-specific raw, intermediate, and analysis-ready data.
- Add a lightweight LaTeX/Beamer scaffold once tables and figures are being exported from Stata.

### Warning for future agents

- Do not assume the current cleaned Cameroon datasets are fully reproducible until the corresponding do-files are added and validated.

## 2026-04-06 - Starter repo scaffolding

### Objective

Create the first runnable repository skeleton around the existing `Data` tree without breaking current Cameroon paths.

### Files created or modified

- `00_master.do`
- `01_setup.do`
- `README.md`
- `.gitignore`
- `code/05_checks/01_repo_checks.do`
- `Data/WBES_manual/README.md`
- `AGENTS.md`
- `SESSIONS.md`

### Key decisions

- Standardized the starter architecture around the existing top-level `Data/` directory instead of introducing a separate lowercase `data/` tree, because the repository is on Windows/OneDrive and paths are case-insensitive.
- Added `code/`, `output/`, `logs/`, `manuscript/`, and `slides/` as the forward-looking reproducible structure.
- Made `00_master.do` the pipeline entry point and `01_setup.do` the controlled place for root-path setup, folder creation, and package installation.
- Installed `estout`, `ftools`, and `reghdfe` in setup when missing, with `estout` treated as required because `esttab`/`estout` is the default table workflow.
- Added a WBES manual intake folder under `Data/WBES_manual/` for documented manual additions.
- Added `.gitignore` rules that keep large/proprietary data, generated outputs, logs, and LaTeX build artifacts out of version control by default.

### Important assumptions

- Existing data under `Data/Cameroon/` and `Data/World Bank Enterprise Survey/` should remain in place until the missing Cameroon do-files are recovered and a deliberate migration path is chosen.
- Generated outputs in `output/` should be reproducible and therefore ignored by Git unless a future task requires tracking selected artifacts.

### Unresolved issues / next steps

- Review the initial file set and make the first commit.
- Recover or write the Cameroon cleaning and analysis scripts under `code/`.
- Decide whether `Data/Cameroon/Clean/` should remain the long-run location for country-level processed files or eventually migrate to `Data/Intermediate/` and `Data/Analysis/`.

### Verification

- Initialized Git at the project root.
- Ran `00_master.do` successfully in Stata.
- Confirmed that `01_setup.do` created the starter folder structure and that `code/05_checks/01_repo_checks.do` passed.
